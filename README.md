# Finite State Vim Color scheme

A simple, dark color scheme with subtle coloring. I forked this from https://github.com/tek256/simple-dark. Where I
admire his aim to have a color scheme with no distractions, I still need a couple things just a smidge more noticeable.

## Install

### LINUX/UNIX
```Bash
git clone git@github.com:wesleyParriott/finite_state.git
mv finite_state/finite_state.vim .
rm -rf finite_state
```

### Windows
Just download from github, unzip the package, copy the finite\_state.vim from the finite\_state folder, and paste into
your vim colors directory

## Usage
Open your vimrc and put `colorscheme finite_state` anywhere in the file
